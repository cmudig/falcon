# Hey you!

For the index manipulation and aggregation we use an multidimensional array (ndarray).

Want to implement something faster? Go ahead!

Reimplement ops and ndarray, and everything should just work!

One specific place that would be interesting to try is representing this as a tensorflow tensor, and using tensorflow's ops that use webgl in the background.

## Note to self (Donny)

These files are blank right now, once the first iteration is implemented, It will be obvious what common function are necessary and how to translate the api into this.
