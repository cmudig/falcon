**ðŸš§ Work in Progress**

Crossfilter millions of records without latencies. This fork of [Falcon](https://github.com/vega/falcon) offers an API, so you can crossfilter on your own data and own charts!

## Development

```bash
yarn       # install packages for entire workspace
yarn dev   # runs demo in browser
```

A new browser tab should open with a demo that uses the`falcon` library.

Changes made in the `falcon` package and svelte `examples` will hot reload the user interface.

## Overview

### Data

Falcon supports

-   Javascript Objects
-   Arrow
-   DuckDB
-   HTTP (sends `GET` request with a `SQL` query)
-   MapD

for more details check out the implementations in `falcon/src/core/db`

### Views

Falcon supports `0D` and `1D` views at the moment. `1D` meaning binned counts (histogram) across that dimension/column. `0D` being no dimension: just total counts across the entire data.

Only continuos data is supported right now. Categorical data will be supported soon.

`2D` views (like heatmaps) will be brought back after supporting categorical data.
