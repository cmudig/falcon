**ðŸš§ Work in Progress**

Crossfilter millions of records without latencies. This is a new version of [Falcon](https://github.com/vega/falcon) with cleaned up APIs and reusable components.

## Developers

Just so we can take advantage of the old code, right now its in the `old` directory. This will be removed when Falcon 2 is a package. Simply for convenience for now.

### Falcon 2 â€“ Getting Started

This one is currently being developed through the example. Not yet compiling to its own package. The ts source for falcon 2 is in the `src` directory. But we'll run an example of its use in the `examples` directory.

```bash
cd examples/flights-in-browser
yarn # make sure to install dependencies
yarn dev --open # to start the dev server and open the browser
```

Then you can modify the code in `src` (falcon 2 code) and see changes in the example project in your browser with a real example. More examples will be made for mode dbs as time goes on.

### Old Falcon (version 1) â€“ Getting Started

Inside of the `old` directory, install the dependencies with `yarn`. Then run `yarn start` to start the flight demo with in memory data. Have a look at the other `script` commands in [`package.json`](https://github.com/vega/falcon/blob/master/package.json).
