# People contributing

Lets just go by these standards for now

1. `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, and whatever else Dominik was using for commit messages. For example a commit message with a new code feature can be `feat: added confetti to the code`.
2. Pull request, one person review, then merge into main.
3. If the code very likely will need a refactor, write a small test.
4. If the code is non-intuitive, write a small test.
5. If you have mental energy, on functions write the justification for why it is the way it is in a comment so people later on won't have a hard time. See `old` falcon for examples.
